# Sprinkles

An analog Homer Simpson watch face that supports every Pebble watch, from the Pebble Classic to the Pebble Time Round.


Homer's eyes follow a sprinkled donut on either the minute or seconds hand.

* Center dot color

* Seconds hand color
* Show date
* Date background color
* Date text color

## Building on Mac OSX

Make sure you have the latest version of the Pebble SDK Homebrew package installed:

```
brew update
brew install pebble-sdk
brew upgrade pebble-sdk # if already installed
```

Next install the latest version of the Pebble SDK using the pebble tool:

```
pebble sdk list # list the available versions of the SDK
pebble sdk install X.Y # replace "X.Y" with any newer version of the SDK
```

This is a little bit of a hack, but enamel has some Python requirements that you must install into the site-packages directory used by the Pebble SDK. This is the command I used to install them at time of writing, but it might be slightly different in the future (e.g. the "4.0" might change as the Pebble SDK is upgradedto newer versions).

```
pip install --target=/usr/local/Cellar/pebble-sdk/4.0/libexec/vendor/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ -r ./enamel/requirements.txt
```

Finally, build the watchface:

```
pebble build
```

And install it into the emulator of the platform of your choice (chalk shown below) with:

```
pebble install --emulator chalk
```

Or install it on your watch after enabling the Developer Connection in your Pebble Time iPhone/Android app with:

```
pebble install --phone IP_ADDRESS
```
